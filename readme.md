# Weekly Activities

Track your active presence on the computer.

The perfect tool for the lazy/smart programmers who want to track their presences in order to fill the timesheet at work.

You have the start time, the end time and the active duration. You can see the previous weeks as well. Everything is stored locally.

When there is no activity in the last 5 minutes, it consider you away.

The only thing you have to do is to let it run. You can minimize it and forget it.
